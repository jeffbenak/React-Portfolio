# My React Portfolio

## Description
- This is my react portfolio that includes an about me tab, a resume tab, a portfolio tab and a contact tab.
- Each page has a link to my github, linkedin, and email where you can contact me at.
- The contact tab isn't fully functional right now, but I would like to add functionality to it in the near future. 
- The resume tab lists the elements of coding that I have worked with and therefore what I am most comfortable with. 
- The portfolio page includes a couple projects I have done myself or worked on in a group.
- You can click on the title for the deployed application, or view the github repository if you click the github icon. 
- The site is pretty easy to navigate around, and you shouldn't have any problems viewing each page. 
- If you have any feedback on anything, please email me at jeff.benak@yahoo.com.
